# Vending Machine System Using D Flip-Flops

## Project Overview

This project implements a digital vending machine system using D flip-flops, basic logic gates, and a clock signal. The vending machine processes user inputs (such as coin insertion and selection) and dispenses the selected item based on a defined sequence of operations.

## Features
 
- **Coin Validation**: The system validates if the correct amount has been inserted.  
- **Dispense Item**: Dispenses the selected item once conditions are met.  
- **Reset Functionality**: Resets the system to the initial state for a new transaction.  


## Project Components

- **D Flip-Flops**: Used to store and manage the vending machine's current state.  
- **Logic Gates**: AND, OR, and NOT gates define the logic for state transitions.  
- **Clock Signal**: Provides timed pulses to control state progression.  
- **Inputs**: User inputs such as coin insertion and item selection.  
- **Output Signals**: Represent item dispensing and machine states.  


## Circuit Design

The circuit uses multiple D flip-flops to track the machine's states, including coin insertion, item selection, and dispensing. Logic gates define the conditions for moving between states. The system sequence follows these steps:

1. **Idle State**: Waits for a coin to be inserted.  
2. **Selection State**: Allows the user to choose an item.  
3. **Validation State**: Checks if sufficient funds have been provided.  
4. **Dispense State**: Dispenses the item and resets for the next transaction.  


## How It Works

1. **Initial State**: The vending machine is idle, waiting for a coin.  
2. **State Transitions**: 
   - Coin Inserted -> Transition to selection.  
   - Item Selected -> Validate the coin.  
   - Validation Successful -> Dispense the item and reset.  
3. **Clock Control**: Each transition is triggered by the clock pulse to ensure synchronization.  


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To simulate this circuit, you may need:

- Digital logic design software like **Proteus** or **Logisim**.  
- A basic understanding of D flip-flops and logic gate operations.  

### Running the Circuit

1. **Set up the Circuit**:  
   - Connect D flip-flops, logic gates, inputs, and outputs as per the schematic.  
2. **Provide Inputs**:  
   - Simulate coin insertion and item selection.  
3. **Run the Clock Signal**:  
   - Trigger the clock to progress through states.  
4. **Observe Output**:  
   - Watch the vending machine dispense the selected item and reset for the next user.  


## Future Enhancements

- Add a **multi-item selection system** with more states and flip-flops.  
- Implement **change dispensing** functionality for overpaid amounts.  
- Introduce **low-stock warnings** for items.  
- Add an **LCD interface** for better user interaction.
